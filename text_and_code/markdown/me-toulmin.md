# Mini-Essay: Toulmin Model
## Planning list (aka mini-essay)
* Enthymeme: All local governments should require the ability to activate  warming centers year-round so that almost no one dies when a cold snap occurs.
* Grounds: I have to show why _not_ having warming centers at the ready will kill those who are homeless.
  *  Warming centers provide a warm place when other places that might help keep them warm, such as libraries, are closed (Pallet Shelter).
  *  Some homeless people are less apt to use more traditional solutions like shelters (Murphy).
  *  "Guests reported a high level
of appreciation for the provision of the service" because it provides a place to weather out the storm and keep their stuff and themselves out of trouble, in addition to keeping themselves out of the cold weather" (Young and Michael).
*  Warrant: If the warming centers are not kept ready-to-open, then many people will die of the cold.
*  Backing: How can I show this?
   *  "Dr. Chance Sullivan at the University of Vermont Medical Center said people experiencing homelessness are among the highest risk populations for developing frostbite. 'You might start to notice some pain—some redness and some swelling—at the hands at the nose at the feet,” he said. 'These are some of the most commonly places that are affected'" (qtd. in Casalo).
   *  "Flint added that because the pandemic has placed capacity restrictions on homeless shelters, there are now more people without shelter this year who otherwise would have a place to stay" (Branciforte).
   *  "'Shelters began because there was a gentleman by the name of Freedom that froze to death in Santa Barbara on a very cold night,' said the Good Samaritan Director of Homeless Services Kirsten Cahoon. 'And didn’t have a shelter to go to'" (qtd. in Cruz-Orduña).

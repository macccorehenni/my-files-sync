# Submission: [Subaru Dog Tested: Dog Driving Lessons](https://youtu.be/Jl-CzC2HLKo)

## Description: 
This commercial shows a teenaged dog learning how to drive, its mother on the lawn and father beside it. It does great, *until* a gaggle of geese flies overhead and distracts all involved. Then, the father dog and mother dog duck (no pun intended) as the dog learning to drive runs over the mailbox, and only then successfully gets out from between the cones that his car was parked between. In the midst of the aftermath, a message saying "Dog Tested. Dog Approved®" appears on the screen, followed by the jingle, "Love. It's what makes Subaru, Subaru."

## Artistic proofs:
### Kairos
This advertisement has not really any kairos. I don't believe it would need any, given that the focus on the ad is the *emotion* and not the timing of the ad. Vehicle buying is a long and costly process, and the goal of this ad is to convince someone to go with Subaru rather then any of the other brands that are their competitors.

### Ethos
The ethos is in the catchline of "Dog Tested. Dog Approved.". While we normally don't (and shouldn't) think of our dogs as scientific or otherwise credible entities, we do tend to think of them as a car-loving species, lending credibility to the ad. Subaru, however, left out the normal ethos-seeking method of the auto industry— the awards from JP Power and others. But the "pup authority" really distracts from that idea.
